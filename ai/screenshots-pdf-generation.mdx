# Screenshots and PDF Generation

The Playwright MCP can capture what your users see by taking screenshots or generating print-friendly PDF documents. Use screenshots for visual regression testing, debugging UI failures, or documenting application states. Use PDF generation to create shareable, high-fidelity artifacts of your web content for reports or offline viewing.

## Screenshots

Playwright can capture screenshots of the current page via the MCP server. Ask the agent to navigate to a page and save a screenshot with an optional filename. If omitted, a timestamped name like `page-<timestamp>.png` is used.

Typical flow:
1. Navigate to the page and wait for the UI to load (network idle, images and fonts loaded).
2. Optionally set viewport and expand sections you want visible.
3. Save a screenshot.

### Example Prompt full page screenshot

```bash
Navigate to playwright.dev and take a screenshot and save it as playwright.png
```

### Example Prompt partial screenshot

```bash
navigate to playwright.dev and find the footer and take a screenshot of it
```

## PDF Generation

PDF generation is an opt-in capability that lets the agent render the current page to a PDF file which is useful for creating print-friendly versions of web content.

### Enable the capability

Add the `--caps=pdf` argument to your Playwright MCP server configuration, for example in your `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest", 
        "--caps=pdf"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Prompt pdf generation

```bash
navigate to playwright.dev, wait for images to load and save the page as a PDF named "mcp-test.pdf".
```

## Setting the Output Directory

By default the generated PDF is written to the MCP server's artifacts location. If you set `--output-dir` the file will be written there; otherwise the server may use a default like `.playwright-mcp/`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--caps=pdf",
        "--output-dir",
        "full/path/to/output/folder"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
