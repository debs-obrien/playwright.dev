## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to install the Playwright MCP server for your favorite MCP client. For many clients, like VS Code, this is a simple, one-click process.

<a class="button button--primary" href="vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22playwright%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22%40playwright%2Fmcp%40latest%22%5D%7D">Install in VS Code</a>

This will create a new MCP server configuration in a JSON file in your VS Code settings.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once installed, you can start giving the agent commands to control your browser right away.
