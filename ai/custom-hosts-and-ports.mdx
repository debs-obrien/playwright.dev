## Custom Port & Standalone MCP server

Use a custom port to avoid conflicts or to run the MCP server as a long lived process (keeping a headed browser open) and let the client connect over HTTP (SSE).

Steps:
1. In the MCP client config, use a "url" pointing to the running server.
2. In a terminal, start the server: `npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port <port>` [other flags]`
3. The client reconnects as needed; the browser session persists.

Headed browser on a machine without display access:
- Start the server where a display exists (desktop, VM with X11/Wayland/xvfb, macOS GUI).
- Remote / IDE processes without DISPLAY just use the url.

Example:
1. Config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Run the MCP server in your terminal specifying the port for SSE transport:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 3001
```
Then in your chat you can ask to navigate to localhost:3001 and use the Playwright MCP server on that port


## Binding to a Specific Host

By default, the MCP server binds to `localhost`. You can change this with the `--host` flag. Use `0.0.0.0` to bind to all available network interfaces.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--host",
        "0.0.0.0"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
