description: Enable and configure vision capabilities for Playwright MCP (`--caps=vision`).
---

Enable vision with `--caps=vision` to let the agent visually inspect the page.

Adds coordinate mouse tools:
- `browser_mouse_click_xy` (click)
- `browser_mouse_drag_xy` (press + drag)
- `browser_mouse_move_xy` (hover only)

All use viewport CSS pixel coords (0,0 topâ€‘left) and require a brief element description for permission. Click/drag mutate page state; move is read-only (hover events only). Use a headed (or virtual) display for reliability.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--caps=vision",
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
