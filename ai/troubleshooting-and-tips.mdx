Quick troubleshooting steps and tips for common problems.

## Missing browsers

- Run Playwright's install step in your project or use `browser_install` tooling to fetch browser binaries.

## Client can't connect

- Verify `--port` and that no firewall blocks SSE/HTTP.
- Confirm the MCP server `--host` and the client's `url` match (including `/mcp` path).

## Collecting artifacts

- Use `--output-dir` to store traces, screenshots and saved sessions.
- Use `--save-trace` and `--save-screenshots` flags where appropriate.

## Helpful tips

- Prefer `--isolated` for untrusted pages and CI environments.
- Use `--viewport-size` with consistent dimensions for deterministic visual tests.


### Controlling Image Responses

To save bandwidth, you can prevent the server from sending image data to the client using the `--image-responses` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--image-responses",
        "omit"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
