description: Running Playwright MCP headless on CI and tips for stable CI execution.
---

By default, Playwright MCP launches a headed browser so you can see the automation happen. For CI/CD environments or when a visible UI is not needed, you can run in headless mode using the `--headless` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## CI tips

- Prefer `--isolated` for CI to avoid shared profiles.
- Use `--output-dir` to collect traces and artifacts for failing runs.
- Pin browser versions or run `npx playwright install` in CI to ensure browsers are available.
