## Networking and Security

These options are for configuring proxies, origins, and security policies.

### Using a Proxy Server

If you need to route traffic through a proxy, you can use the `--proxy-server` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--proxy-server",
        "http://myproxy:3128"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Bypassing a Proxy for Specific Domains

To bypass the proxy for certain domains, use the `--proxy-bypass` flag with a comma-separated list of domains.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--proxy-server",
        "http://myproxy:3128",
        "--proxy-bypass",
        ".com,chromium.org"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Allowing and Blocking Origins

You can control which domains the browser is allowed to access. Use `--allowed-origins` to whitelist specific domains and `--blocked-origins` to blacklist them.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--allowed-origins",
        "https://www.microsoft.com",
        "--blocked-origins",
        "https://www.google.com"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Disabling the Sandbox

In certain restricted environments (like some Docker containers), you may need to disable the browser's sandbox for it to run. Use the `--no-sandbox` flag with caution.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--no-sandbox"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Blocking Service Workers

In some testing scenarios, service workers can interfere with network requests. You can block them entirely with the `--block-service-workers` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--block-service-workers"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security recommendations

- Restrict `--allowed-origins` when exposing the server on networks. By default the server allows all origins â€” when running on non-localhost, set an allowlist.
- Use `--host=127.0.0.1` or default `localhost` for local-only usage. Use firewall rules when binding to `0.0.0.0`.
- Avoid running untrusted web content with persistent profiles; prefer `--isolated` for untrusted sessions.
