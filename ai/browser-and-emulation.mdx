description: Options for selecting browsers, device emulation, viewport sizes and user agents.
---


These settings let you control which browser Playwright uses and how it simulates devices and environments. Below you'll find concise JSON `mcpServers` examples you can paste into your configuration, along with guidance on when to use each option and a few troubleshooting tips.

## Choose the right option

- Browser selection (`--browser`): use when reproducing browser-specific behavior (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Edge).
- Device emulation (`--device`): use for responsive layout tests, touch interactions, and mobile-specific features.
- Viewport and user agent (`--viewport-size`, `--user-agent`): useful for targeted layout checks and simulating specific clients.
- Executable path (`--executable-path`): use a system or custom browser build instead of Playwright's bundled browsers.
- Ignore HTTPS errors (`--ignore-https-errors`): only for local development where self-signed certs are unavoidable.

## Browser Selection

Using a specific browser (example: msedge):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--browser",
        "msedge"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Prompt browser selection

```bash
navigate to playwright.dev and tell me what browser you are using
```

If prompted to "Install the browser specified in the config", choose Allow. Playwright will download the required browser if missing, and the run will launch Microsoft Edge (msedge) instead of the default bundled Chromium.

## Device Emulation

Emulating a mobile device (example: iPhone 13):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--device",
        "iPhone 13"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Prompt device emulation

```bash
navigate to playwright.dev and wait for the page to load, then take a screenshot and save it as iphone13.png
```

You should now have a full page screenshot emulating an iPhone 13 device.

## Custom Viewport

Setting a custom viewport size (example: 1600x720):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--viewport-size",
        "1600,720"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Prompt viewport size

```bash
navigate to playwright.dev and tell me what viewport size is being used
```

## Custom User Agent

Using a custom user agent:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--user-agent",
        "MyCustomUserAgent/1.0"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom Executable Path

Specifying a browser executable path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--executable-path",
        "/path/to/your/browser"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
## Ignore HTTPS Errors

Ignore HTTPS errors (development only):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--ignore-https-errors"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
