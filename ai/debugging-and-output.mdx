description: Guidance on saving traces, specifying output directories, and other debugging tips for Playwright MCP.

These settings are useful for development, troubleshooting, and saving artifacts from your sessions.

### Saving a Trace of the Session

The Playwright MCP can record a detailed trace of the session, which is invaluable for debugging. Use the `--save-trace` flag to enable this feature. The trace file will be saved in the `.playwright-mcp` directory.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--save-trace"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Open the saved trace (must be zipped before viewing or sharing):

1. Locate the trace folder under `.playwright-mcp/` (e.g. `.playwright-mcp/trace-<timestamp>`).
2. Zip it and rename it to `trace.zip`, and then launch the Trace Viewer:
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
  ```

### Specifying an Output Directory

You can set a directory for output files, such as traces, screenshots and saved sessions, using the `--output-dir` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--output-dir",
        "full/path/to/output/folder"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional tips:
- Use `--output-dir` to collect sessions, saved traces and artifacts for debugging.
- Many tools (PDF export, saved sessions) write to `--output-dir` if set, otherwise `.playwright-mcp/`.
