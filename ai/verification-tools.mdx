## Verify / Verification tools

Verification tools are opt-in via `--caps=verify` and provide read-only assertions against the page snapshot.

Tools:
- `browser_verify_element_visible`: Assert an element is visible by accessibility role + accessibleName (preferred; stable).
- `browser_verify_text_visible`: Assert raw text is present (fallback when no suitable role/name; prefer the element variant when possible).
- `browser_verify_list_visible`: Assert a list (e.g. nav, menu, listbox) contains the exact expected items. Provide both a brief human description and the exact snapshot ref plus the expected item strings.
- `browser_verify_value`: Assert an element's current value/state (inputs, selects, checkboxes, radios). For checkboxes/radios use "true"/"false".

These actions only inspect the page state and return pass/fail results (no mutations), so prefer exact snapshot refs or accessible-role/name matches for reliable verification.
