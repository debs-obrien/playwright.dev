## FAQ

### What's the difference between MCP automation and Playwright tests?
MCP sessions are interactive and ephemeral (good for exploration and drafting). Playwright tests are versioned, repeatable code run in CI for regression prevention.

### When do I use Copy Prompt vs Fix with AI?
Use Copy Prompt to shuttle rich failure context into chat for deeper reasoning. Use Fix with AI for a fast inline suggestion when the change is likely mechanical.

### Is it safe to paste credentials into chat?
No. Use placeholders (e.g. `{{USER}}`) or storage state. Never paste secrets; rotate dedicated test accounts instead.

### How do I reuse a logged-in session with AI?
Launch via the MCP browser extension attached to an existing profile or export/import Playwright storage state (`--save-storage` / load in config) before asking the agent to act.

### Headless or headed for AI-driven workflows?
Start headed while iterating (visual trust), then switch to headless for speed once stable. AI does not "see" pixels—only accessibility data—so headed adds no vision beyond human verification.

### The agent picked a brittle locator—what now?
Ask MCP to list accessible roles/names for that region and regenerate a semantic locator (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`). Replace rather than layering multiple fallbacks.

### Can the AI run my whole test suite in CI?
Today it's best used to generate and maintain tests. The suite itself should run via standard `npx playwright test` in CI—AI is optional for interactive repair, not required for execution.

### When should I promote an automation script into a test?
If you'll reuse it ≥3 times, it guards a critical path, or a failure should block deploys—promote it to a Playwright test or helper library.

### How do I handle sensitive production data?
Prefer staging. If production is required: least privilege accounts, explicit confirmation prompts, logging of changes, and no credential exposure in chat.

### Why did Fix with AI suggest an over-simplified change?
Inline fix heuristics optimize for speed. If the suggestion removes meaningful assertions, reject it and ask in chat for a more robust alternative referencing the actual DOM via MCP.

### Can the agent see dynamically rendered elements?
Yes, once they are in the accessibility tree. If something is missing, ensure the UI has completed rendering (wait for network/animation) before requesting the tree.

### Does MCP enable image or visual diffing?
No—MCP exposes structured accessibility data, not pixels. Use Playwright's built-in screenshot or snapshot tooling for visual comparisons.
